This isn't so comp-sci related; just a fun project. I was inspired to create these visualizaions after reading the books: 'Chaos' by James Gleik, and Benoit Mandlebrot's 'The Fractal Geometry of Nature'.
-----------------------
Just some fun visualizations - p.s. read those books they are good, and only the one by Mandlebrot has a lot of math in it :)
