# complexVis
--------
This isn't so comp-sci related; just a fun project. I was inspired to create these visualizaions after reading the books: 'Chaos' by James Gleik, and Benoit Mandlebrot's 'The Fractal Geometry of Nature'.

Just some fun visualizations - p.s. read those books they are good, and only the one by Mandlebrot has a lot of math in it :)

( The code isn't all that great because you end up needing to manually calculate the complex zeroes of the functions and hard code those in - but eh who cares this was just a quick day-long project )
